# Pathfinder-in-ConceptNet
Finds the path between any two given concepts in ConceptNet (under construction) ONLY on the basis of IsA relationships.

Basically if you have two items and you want to see how they're related in terms of an categorial / ontological basis, you use this to find a path in ConceptNet. 

For eg. apple is a food, hence
apple -> fruit -> food

Send me edge cases where the code fails and pictures of cats at dassg@rpi.edu, thanks

Usage:

python relation.py apple food
